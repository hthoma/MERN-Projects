# Misc Web Projects

This repo will be used to host small stuff I make for the web. Nothing big.

**Project Index**

 1. Webscanner/Emailer
 This is a NodeJS project that will take rap artists through arguments in command line, then use Cheerio to scan through the Billboard hot rap songs. If your artist(s) is/are on the charts it will send you all the songs they have on the charts and the number spot they hold over email using NodeMailer. Credentials have been redacted such as email and password and will need to be filled in to create a working project.
